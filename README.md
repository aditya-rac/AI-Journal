# AI-Driven Case Study Automation

This project is designed to help professionals or students quickly create detailed case studies on any given topic without having to manually script everything. By leveraging AI tools like Perplexity and ChatGPT, this system automates the process of gathering requirements, conducting research, and generating a well-structured case study. The project uses chat completions to generate responses based on structured prompts, predicting and crafting content for each section of the case study.

Chat completions refer to the process where an AI model, like ChatGPT, generates responses based on a series of structured prompts or inputs from a conversation. The AI uses the context provided in the conversation to predict and complete the next logical step in the dialogue, which can involve answering questions, generating text, or performing specific tasks.

## Project Overview

The repository contains three core Python scripts:
- `req.py`: Gathers the specific requirements for the case study.
- `res.py`: Conducts in-depth research based on the gathered requirements.
- `con.py`: Uses the research to generate the case study content, organized into logical sections.

### Key Features
- **AI-Driven Research**: The project leverages Perplexity’s API for web scraping and gathering detailed information.
- **AI Content Generation**: ChatGPT-4o is used for generating high-quality written content based on the research.
- **Modular Design**: Each script can be used independently or as part of a pipeline.
- **Automated References**: Research sources (URLs) are automatically saved in a separate file for proper attribution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- API Keys for:
  - [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
  - [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/)
- Install the required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install requests openai
  ```

### How It Works

1. **Gather Requirements**:
   - The `req.py` script is used to generate the requirements for the case study. You can specify the topic, and it will pull out detailed points for research and analysis.
   
   ```bash
   python req.py
   ```

2. **Conduct Research**:
   - The `res.py` script takes the output from `req.py` and gathers relevant research based on the URLs or performs personal research using Perplexity's API. The research is saved to a file, and the references are saved in a separate file.

   ```bash
   python res.py
   ```

3. **Generate the Case Study**:
   - The `con.py` script uses the research data generated by `res.py` to produce a structured case study. It divides the content into sections like Introduction, Historical Context, and Conclusion.

   ```bash
   python con.py
   ```

## File Structure

- `req.py`: Gathers requirements for the case study.
- `res.py`: Extracts detailed research and saves references.
- `con.py`: Generates the final case study.
- `txt2doc.py`: Convert the text file to document

## Files that shall be Created
- `<TOPIC>_requirements_explanation.txt`: Contains the specific requirements for the case study.
- `<TOPIC>_research.txt`: Contains the research data pulled from various sources.
- `<TOPIC>_references.txt`: Contains the references (URLs) used for the research.
- `<TOPIC>_case_study_content.txt`: The final case study content generated.

## Example Usage

Let’s say you want to create a case study on "The Rise of AI in the 2020s":

1. Run `req.py` to generate the requirements:
   ```bash
   python req.py
   ```
   This will create a file named `Topic_requirements_explanation.txt`.

2. Run `res.py` to conduct research:
   ```bash
   python res.py
   ```
   The research will be saved in `Topic_research.txt`, and the sources will be saved in `Topic_references.txt`.

3. Run `con.py` to generate the case study:
   ```bash
   python con.py
   ```
   The final case study will be saved in `Topic_case_study_content.txt`.

4. Run `txt2doc.py` only if you want help converting text document to word document, with headers adapting to hashtags

## Customization

- You can modify the `req.py` script to customize the requirements for different types of case studies.
- You can add or replace the URLs in `res.py` with your own research sources.
- The sections in the final case study can be customized in `con.py` to suit different types of content needs.

## Appendix

- Appendix vastly depends on what a person is willing to add to their document, for my project I have used images from different companies that support the thesis, which is a simple google seach, hence having a code for it should not make sense. I will update the project when I figure out how to create enhancing visual representations with plotly or matplotlib with AI generated transcripts.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more AI models for improved research and writing.
- Experiment with other APIs (e.g., Anthropic) for better scraping and research quality.
- Exploring how to generate good visual repsresentations using AI transcripts
- Improve error handling and debugging.

### Placeholder Explanation

This project includes several placeholders in the code that need to be customized or filled in by the user before running the scripts. Below is a breakdown of these placeholders and instructions on how to handle them:

1. **API Key Placeholder (`<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE>`)**:
   - **Location**: `authenticate_openai_api()` function in `con.py`
   - **Description**: Replace `<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE>` with your actual OpenAI API key. This is required to authenticate and make API requests to generate case study content.
   - **How to update**: Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and add it as a string in the `openai.api_key` line.

   ```python
   def authenticate_openai_api():
       openai.api_key = "sk-your-api-key"
   ```

2. **Topic Placeholder (`TOPIC NAME`)**:
   - **Location**: `topic` variable in `con.py`
   - **Description**: This is the name of the case study topic you are working on. The topic name will be used to generate file names and provide context for content generation.
   - **How to update**: Replace `"TOPIC NAME"` with the actual topic of your case study.

   ```python
   topic = "AI in the Healthcare Industry"
   ```

3. **Sections Placeholder** (Currently commented out):
   - **Location**: `sections` list in `con.py`
   - **Description**: These are the headings or sections you want in your case study, such as "Introduction," "Current Implementations," etc. By default, the sections are commented out, but you need to define your own sections as required by your case study.
   - **How to update**: Uncomment the `sections` list and modify it to include your custom section titles. Here’s an example:

   - Please replace the sections with what you find appropiate, the following are the ones I used for my project
         ```python
   sections = [
      "Introduction",
       "Market Analysis",
       "Competitive Landscape",
       "Impact",
       "Future Outlook",
       "Conclusion",
       "References"
   ]
   ```


4. **File Naming (`f"{topic.replace(' ', '_')}_research.txt"`)**:
   - **Location**: `read_research_file()` function and `save_case_study_to_file()` function in `con.py`
   - **Description**: The topic name is used to generate filenames for the research and case study files. This ensures the files are properly named based on the case study topic.
   - **How to update**: No need to manually update this, as the filenames are automatically generated using the `topic` variable.

### Summary:
- Replace `<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE>` with your actual OpenAI API key.
- Set the `topic` variable to the case study's subject.
- Uncomment and modify the `sections` list to define the structure of your case study.
